      "Response:  There are several reasons why people choose to become doctors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Desire to help others: Many individuals are drawn to the medical profession because they have a strong desire to make a positive impact on people's lives. Becoming a doctor allows them to directly help patients, alleviate their suffering, and improve their overall health and well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Intellectual challenge: Medicine is a complex and intellectually stimulating field. The pursuit of medical knowledge, understanding intricate medical concepts, and solving complex medical problems can be highly rewarding for individuals who enjoy intellectual challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Job security and stability: The demand for doctors is typically high, and healthcare is considered a recession-proof industry. Becoming a doctor often offers job security and stability, providing individuals with a reliable career path.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Financial rewards: While becoming a doctor requires significant investment in terms of time and money for education and training, it can also lead to substantial financial rewards. Doctors tend to earn high salaries, which can provide them with a comfortable lifestyle and financial stability \n",

      "1. 40s or 50s. This is why they said do not go into medicine for the money. It’s not worth it. Sometimes during residency, one might be expected to work 120 hours per week while earning 50k per year. That’s less than the minimum wage if you break it down by the hour! While I never wanted to become a doctor solely for financial compensation, the high-income potential was a motivator for me. Seeing them break down a doctor’s operating expense and how much they would actually be paying back opened my eyes. And for the first time, I started to really think about my choice. In addition, many aspired to become a doctor because they want to help others who are sick and ill feel better. However, the untold truth is countless deaths that the physician has to witness and hopefully recover. In many cases, they will have to see sick, dying, miserable patients day in and day out. It can be extremely unpleasant to watch your patients die while You couldn’t do anything about it. Sadly, many patients\n",
      "2. we would be motivated to justify our choices and think that it is the right one. The fact that 1 in 2 doctors wouldn’t choose to be one if given the choice is alarming. It’s certainly not an easy career. This is something to note for those of you interested in becoming a doctor. Regrets are not uncommon. Lastly, ask yourself this question. Are you doing this for yourself or for others? Doctors are admirable characters. We look up to them for their vast array of knowledge and a keen interest in helping those in need. Some of your parents might even have persuaded you that it is a good career to pursue. You know how proud they would be if you become a doctor. Perhaps you already told someone else of your dream and you’re afraid to back up now. I know I was in that boat. I didn’t want to go back to high school reunion not having achieve my goals. But remember, this is your life. You don’t get to live in one more time. You only get one shot at this life. Make sure you are making these\n",
      "3. and not simply be a part of the healthcare industry. A common question in UK medical school interviews is ‘why not be a nurse?’. This question is highly applicable to all students considering a career as a doctor and is particularly challenging no matter an applicant’s dedication to becoming a doctor. Medicine is such a diverse field and BS/MD applicants are expected to understand why they are choosing to become a doctor when they can find other fulfilling careers with patients in the healthcare industry. → What kind of doctor do you want to be? No one expects BS/MD applicants to know exactly what specialty they want to pursue, but the idea here, is to stress the importance of understanding that our training as medics is a journey and not a race. BS/MD programs can be extremely fulfilling, but this is dependent on accepted students making the most of their time in these programs. Therefore, one important aspect of student’s applications is to show diversity of thought and study. BS/MD\n"
